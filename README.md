# Simple Tennis Game

This repository contains a small tennis game implemented in Python using `pygame`.
Two iconized players rally a ball back and forth. One player is controlled by
the user while the other is computer-controlled with three selectable
difficulty levels.

## Requirements

* Python 3
* `pygame` (install via `pip install pygame`)

## Running the Game

```
python tennis_game.py [difficulty]
```

`difficulty` can be `easy`, `medium`, or `hard` (default is `easy`).

Use the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys to move your player. Keep the rally going
and try to score more points than the computer.

This game can be run online by using any environment that supports Python with
pygame installed, such as Replit or Gitpod.
